    "We propose in this exercise to explore a high dimensional dataset, and the possible correlations between the dimensions. As a first exploratory case, we will specifically limit ourselves to what we call the colors of stars, i.e. difference of magnitudes (e.g.,  `r-i`), and temperature (`Teff`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The colors of stars are very good tracers of the temperature of a given star. Red colors indicate in general a low surface temperature and blue colors indicate hot temperature. However, this first order approximation is not working well depending on the wavelength at which stars are observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Build a dataset made of the following different colors $u-g, g-r, r-i, i-z$, in addition to temperature and gravity. Plot them all against each other. Look also at their individual distributions. Be clever on how you visualize your data. Explain your thinking, and what do you observe? \n",
    "\n",
    "2. The different colours for a population of stars often show correlations. We propose to find a simple expression of temperature as a function of all the colors we have at our disposal. \n",
    "    1. Explain simply why we could neglect the uncertainties on each measurement thanks to the large number of measurements\n",
    "    2. Fit the relations $T_{eff} = f(u-g, g-r, r-i, i-z)$ and $log_{10} T_{eff} = f(u-g, g-r, r-i, i-z)$ with linear regression methods we learned from the lectures. In this question, we only consider linear terms in the colors. \n",
    "    3. For both relations plot the scaled residuals in temperature `(predicted - given temperature)/(given temperature)` as a function of `temperature` (**linear scaled residuals**). Show that $\\Delta T_{eff}/T_{eff} = \\Delta(\\log_{10}T_{eff})/\\ln(10)$. Compare the efficiency of fitting in linear with fitting in log temperature and conclude.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Now we only select the broadest baseline in wavelength, which is 'u-z' color. Supposedly, it will give us the best leverage on temperature if we limit ourselves to a single color. Do a linear regression on $log_{10} T_{eff} = \\sum_k^N a_k (u-z)^k$, for N from 1 to 4 . Plot the fits and their residuals as before, and compare efficiency with your previous result on $log_{10} T_{eff} = f(u-g, g-r, r-i, i-z)$. Is there a gain to go to higher orders than a degree 2 in the polynomial? Does the results improve with higher degree $N$ of the polynomial? (plot multiple degrees, compare, explain)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. From the previous analysis, we show that a quadratic function in one color is a decent model using a single color. What if we use two colors? Let's use $(u-r, r-z)$ colors and attempt to predict a temperature for each star. Proceed to the linear regression of the polynomial function of the two colors **and their cross-terms**: $T_{eff} = f(u-r, r-z, (u-r)^2, (r-z)^2, (u-r) \\cdot (r-z))$. Compare to the model from question 2.\n",
