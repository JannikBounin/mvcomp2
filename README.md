# Computational Statistics and Data Analysis (MVComp2)

Course LSF entry
Lecturer: PD Dr. Coryn Bailer-Jones
Assistant: Dr. Morgan Fouesneau
Summer semester 2014

This course will provide an introduction to using statistics and computational
methods to analyse data. It comprises one 2-hour lecture per week, plus one
2-hour exercise session per week during which you will put into practice what
you have learned in the lectures. There will also be homework assignments. 

This course will take a pragmatic approach. The focus will be on concepts,
understanding problems, and the application of techniques to solving problems,
rather than reproducing proofs or teaching you recipes to memorize.
