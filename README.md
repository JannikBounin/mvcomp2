# Computational Statistics and Data Analysis (MVComp2)

Course LSF entry

Lecturer: PD Dr. Coryn Bailer-Jones

Assistant: Dr. Morgan Fouesneau

Summer semester 2015

This course will provide an introduction to using statistics and computational
methods to analyse data. It comprises one 2-hour lecture per week, plus one
2-hour exercise session per week during which you will put into practice what
you have learned in the lectures. There will also be homework assignments. 

This course will take a pragmatic approach. The focus will be on concepts,
understanding problems, and the application of techniques to solving problems,
rather than reproducing proofs or teaching you recipes to memorize.

**This repository gives the homeworks related datasets and eventually corrections**

The repository will be updated **after each class** to give the assignments. All datasets, gists of code will also be included.

## Lectures

There will be 12 lectures on the following dates (the exercise session is on the
following day). The topics allocated to the dates may well change!
