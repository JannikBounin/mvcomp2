# Computational Statistics and Data Analysis (MVComp2)

Course LSF entry

Lecturer: PD Dr. Coryn Bailer-Jones

Assistant: Dr. Morgan Fouesneau

Summer semester 2015

This course will provide an introduction to using statistics and computational
methods to analyse data. It comprises one 2-hour lecture per week, plus one
2-hour exercise session per week during which you will put into practice what
you have learned in the lectures. There will also be homework assignments. 

This course will take a pragmatic approach. The focus will be on concepts,
understanding problems, and the application of techniques to solving problems,
rather than reproducing proofs or teaching you recipes to memorize.

**This repository gives the homeworks related datasets and eventually corrections**

The repository will be updated **after each class** to give the assignments. All datasets, gists of code will also be included.

Examples of solutions (hardly unique) will be included eventually.

## Some homework guidelines

**This notebook has no meaning of imposing a format** to give us back your homework. It only gives me a convenient way to keep both texts and codes at the same place.


The assignment for next week is to finish the exploration of the main routines/functions of the language of your choice and to also give the solutions to the exercises: **both** plotting/exploration and exercises parts are expected for next week.


* ** We do not mark your coding skills **, any language is possible, take the one that is convenient and efficient. 
* This means **we do not read the codes**. We do not look out for comments in the codes, but **we will not guess** what a plot means. Be explicit and describe even in once sentence what you did.

* Feel free to use the notebooks (it may not be the most efficient), be careful when printing (Check out nbconvert to produce a pdf or even latex document)

## Computing language

* We do *not* impose the language. Feel free to use any that you judge efficient for
you.  Obviously we cannot provide full support, nor we cannot give full tutorials.

* If you use R, many examples of code will be included in the lecture notes. If
  you use Python, all the exercises will be using python (when coding is
  required).

### Online tools

In case you cannot/do not want to install libraries or softwares on your
computer, some **free** online services exist, such as:

[Sage Cloud](https://cloud.sagemath.com): python, R, and other languages

[Wakari](https://wakari.io/) Python only.


### MCMC libraries

some libraries that you may find useful later depending on your language.

[emcee (python)](http://dan.iel.fm/emcee/current/) 

[STAN (C/C++)](http://mc-stan.org/)

## Lectures

There will be 12 lectures on the following dates (the exercise session is on the
following day). The topics allocated to the dates may well change!
