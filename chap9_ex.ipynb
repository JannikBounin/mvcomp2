    "Carol wants to play a strange game with Bob and Alice. In front on them is a rectangular table. Carol ask Bob and Alice to take positions along one of the short sides of the table. Virtually Carol cuts the table at a random position parallel to the long edge defining a line that Alice and Bob don't know. This stays fixed for the whole game. Carol explains the game to the players: \"You will throw pucks onto the table where ever you want. Any puck stopping on the left side of the line I already defined will give 1 point to Alice, and any on the right side will give one to Bob. The first to get 6 points wins.\"\n",

Select only the games that lead to the current conditions after 8 pucks are thrown, and conclude from this simulation on how many times Bob could win.\n",
